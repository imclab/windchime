## keypainting / windchime

With an undecided name, this is a project to build an ambient synthesizer
based on realtime keylogger data. It's initially aimed at 'coding' and thus
pulls together word-painting tropes like having a `[` start a phrase and
`]` sound a cadence.

This repo should be usable with XCode - new enough to support ARC. Clone
and build.
